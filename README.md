# üîí Privacy-First Password Manager

A secure, TUI-based password and API key manager built with Rust. This application provides a fast, offline-first, and privacy-focused way to manage your sensitive credentials directly from your terminal.


## ‚ú® Features

- **Local-First Storage:** All your data is stored locally in an encrypted vault. You own your data.
- **Strong Encryption:** Utilizes **AES-256-GCM** for authenticated encryption, with a key derived from your master password using **Argon2**.
- **Password & API Key Management:** Store both traditional passwords and API keys with dedicated fields.
- **Modern TUI:** A clean, user-friendly terminal interface built with `tui-rs`.
- **Cross-Platform:** Built with Rust, it compiles and runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Custom Theming:** Customize the application's color scheme to your liking.
- **Auto-Lock on Inactivity:** Automatically locks the vault after a configurable period of inactivity (e.g., 5 or 15 minutes).
- **Import/Export Vault:** Add functionality to export the entire vault to a standard format like CSV or JSON (with a strong warning about it being unencrypted). You could also implement an import feature to migrate from other password managers.
- **Core Functionality:**
  - Add, Edit, and Delete credentials.
  - View credential details with a show/hide toggle for secrets.
  - Reset the entire vault if needed.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rust & Cargo:** Ensure you have the latest version of Rust installed. You can get it from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mohammadreza-mohammadi94/password-manager.git
    cd password-manager
    ```

2.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    cargo run
    ```
    The first time you run it, you will be prompted to create a new master password. This will be the only key to your vault.
